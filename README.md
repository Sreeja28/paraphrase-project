# paraphrase-project

This repository contains a complete implementation, training pipeline, and evaluation framework for a Custom Paraphrase Generator (CPG) built by fine-tuning T5, along with a comparison against an LLM-based paraphrase generator. The system is designed for paragraph-level paraphrasing (200–400 words) and enforces an 80% minimum length constraint, making it suitable for academic, professional, and long-form rewriting tasks.
